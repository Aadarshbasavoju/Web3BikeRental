# Bike Rental Smart Contracts

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for a bike rental system on the Ethereum blockchain. It consists of two contracts:

- `BikeProvider`: Allows bike providers to rent out bikes.
- `Customer`: Allows customers to rent and return bikes.

## Usage

1. Deploy `BikeProvider` contract with a bike price.
2. Deploy `Customer` contract, passing the `BikeProvider` address.
3. Interact with the contracts:
   - Providers can rent bikes to customers.
   - Customers can rent and return bikes.

## Testing

Test the contracts in Remix or any Ethereum development environment by simulating interactions between providers and customers.
